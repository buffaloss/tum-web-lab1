      <h2>Personal & professional description</h2>
      <p>
        I am deeply passionate about the creative intersection of UI/UX design
        and front-end development, where I strive to craft immersive digital
        experiences that seamlessly blend aesthetics with functionality. With a
        dedication to detail and a keen eye for user-centric design principles,
        I aspire to specialize as a UI/UX designer or front-end developer.
